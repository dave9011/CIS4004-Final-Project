								<h3>Indiana clinches No.1 seed in the Eastern Conference, Heat No.2</h3>
							</header>
							<p>With Washington's blowout win over the Heat (with LeBron James and Chris Bosh sitting out for rest before the playoffs), 
								the Indiana Pacers clinched the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference. It accomplishes a major goal for the Pacers, who 
								spoke about wanting home court for a possible Eastern Conference Finals against Miami since the very start of the year.
								It comes later than expected after Indiana got off to a raucous start to begin the year, holding a huge win advantage over 
								nearly every team in the league. But a late-season swoon that started in earnest in early February lead to them battling back 
								and forth for much of March and April with Miami for the top seed...

								<h3>Stanback shines in UCF spring game</h3>
							</header>
							<p>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Central Florida might have found a new leader for its offense at Saturday's spring game, but he's 
								not likely to be a quarterback.
								William Stanback, a sophomore next fall, ran for 108 yards on just five carries and scored once. He was clearly the 
								best player for an offense that just as clearly is going to miss Blake Bortles, who is expected to be one of the first
								quarterbacks taken in next month's NFL Draft.
								The offense had three touchdowns, none in the second half, and two field goals.
								Sophomore Justin Holman and freshmen Pete DiNovo and Tyler Harris took turns quarterbacking the UCF offense that 
								averaged 34.6 points and 441 yards last season with Bortles at the helm...

								<h3>Sykes to P.I.T.</h3>
							</header>
							<p>TORLANDO, Fla. (UCFKnights.com) – Following his illustrious career with the Knights, UCF standout guard Isaiah Sykes 
								has accepted an invitation to play in the prestigious Portsmouth Invitational Tournament later this week.
								Sykes earned an invitation to the event in Virginia, which will feature 64 seniors from across the nation participating 
								in a four-day, 12-game tournament in front of representatives from every NBA team and many international scouts.
								One of the most versatile players in the country, Sykes finished his career at UCF in the top-ten all-time in points 
								(1,545, 8th), rebounds (764, 4th), steals (183, 3rd), and assists (336, 5th).  The guard earned All-American Athletic 
								Conference Second Team...
